# Firing Rate Analysis: RGS14 
Electrophysiological recordings from the cortex served as the foundational data used for extracting information. 
Properties such as the neuron type (interneuron or pyramidal), spike-wave characteristics and firing rate were calculated across treatments and experimental conditions. 
The firing rate analysis was used to compute and compare firing rates in different sleep stages. Using this information, phase preference for neuronal populations during slow-wave sleep was computed. 
The firing rate data in NREM sleep was used to compute the cortical response to hippocampal ripples. 
These results were calculated for both treatments and then compared.
